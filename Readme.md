# LoRA Fine-Tuning for Stable Diffusion: A Portfolio Project

This project showcases a professional and modular pipeline for fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). It demonstrates practical skills in deep learning, MLOps principles, and Python development by creating a clear, maintainable, and highly configurable training and inference system.

The goal of this project is to provide a robust framework for creating custom Stable Diffusion models for a specific subject or style with minimal computational overhead. The entire process, from data preparation to model inference, is designed to be easily reproducible and scalable.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Modular Codebase**: The project is structured into logical Python files (`model_utils.py`, `dataset.py`, `training_and_sampling.py`, `inference.py`), making it easy to understand, modify, and extend.
* **LoRA Support**: Efficiently fine-tune large Stable Diffusion models by only training a small number of parameters, significantly reducing GPU memory usage and training time.
* **Configurable Training**: All training parameters are defined in an external `training_config.json` file, allowing for easy experimentation and version control of different training runs.
* **Automatic Sample Generation**: Generate sample images at regular intervals during training to monitor progress and provide visual feedback.
* **`safetensors` support**: The final LoRA weights are saved in the recommended `safetensors` format for secure and fast loading.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need the following to run this project:

* Python 3.8 or higher
* A CUDA-compatible GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM (16GB recommended for larger resolutions)
* Hugging Face account for model downloads (if using gated models)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/sd-lora-finetune.git](https://github.com/your_username/sd-lora-finetune.git)
    cd sd-lora-finetune
    ```

2.  Prepare your dataset. Place your images in a directory, with each image having a corresponding `.txt` file containing its caption. The caption should include your unique `trigger_phrase`.

    **Example:**

    ```
    /your_images_path/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_image1.png
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_image1.txt  (e.g., "A photo of [trigger] playing guitar")
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_image2.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_image2.txt  (e.g., "An illustration of [trigger] reading a book")
    ```
